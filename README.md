# Chatroom
Created a Chatroom with socket.io and created a chatbot that can answer questions that have been answered

After a question is asked, if the bot doesn't know the answer, it will await the next response. Assuming that the response is not a question itself. The next response will be stored as an answer. (the question's are not case sensitive, however, they must match exactly aside from capitilzation)
