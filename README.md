# Chatroom
Created a Chatroom with socket.io and created a chatbot that can answer questions that have been answered

After a question is asked, if the bot doesn't know the answer, it will await the next response. Assuming that the response is not a question itself. The next response will be stored as an answer. (the question's are not case sensitive, however, they must match exactly aside from capitilzation)

Instructions to get up and running: 

1) clone the chatroom
2) go to the chatroom directory
3) npm install
4) npm start
5) http://localhost:3000
